# Currency-conversion
This is my second cpp program that I wrote when I first started learning cpp back in 2020. It basically will calculate the money that I spent when I traveled to three countries in Latin America, the result will be in USD, after calculating the exchange rate on the day the money was spent.

Simple program to calculate the money spent on holiday in Latin America.
